 * `@blobatar/solid` — the Solid adapter.

 * thing ADR-0009 split the packages to make possible. An earlier attempt at
 * three adapters as subpaths of core could not hold five mutually
 * incompatible JSX transforms in one `Bun.build` call, gave up, and hand-rolled
 * `document.createElementNS` instead — shipping a Preact adapter that rendered
 * an empty string. Build isolation is what this package spends its existence
 * on; `scripts/build.ts` is where it collects it.
 *
 * So: no DOM construction here. Anything written against `document` renders
 * nowhere there is no `document`, which is every SSR consumer and the harness
 * row that would have caught the empty string.

  /*
   * `<Show>` rather than the ternary this used to be, and the difference is not
   * style — it is whether the `<svg>` survives a prop change.
   *
   * Solid wraps a dynamic child expression in one computation, so a branch
   * written as `parts() ? <svg…> : <img…>` re-runs whenever *anything* it reads
   * changes: a new `name`, a new `hue`, a new size. Re-running it builds a new
   * element and swaps it in, which is the failure the comment inside is about,
   * one level up — a fresh `<svg>` has no previous computed value either, so
   * every idle animation under it restarts from phase zero and any driver
   * holding the old element is left pointing at a detached node. It is the
   * only adapter that did this; React, Preact, Vue and Svelte all keep the
   * element and update its attributes.
   *
   * A non-keyed `<Show>` memoizes on the *condition* rather than on the value,
   * so the branch is built once and stays while `parts()` keeps returning
   * something. Everything inside it is an ordinary reactive attribute, updated
   * in place, which is what the other four have always done.
   *
   * Caught by `the excursion survives a prop change` in
   * `packages/harness/scripts/probe-gaze.ts`, which reports the swap in so many
   * words.

            `<title>` names the element it is the first child of, and the
            backdrop must sit outside the hover-lift or the plate scales
