/**
 * Bundle size gate for what the packages *ship*.
 *
 * `packages/blobatar/scripts/size.ts` is the other half of this and measures
 * something different on purpose: its synthetic consumers import `../../src/*`,
 * so it measures what the source tree-shakes to. That is the right instrument
 * for "did a palette tweak double the colour code", and the wrong one for "does
 * `bun add @blobatar/react` cost what we think", because nothing in it ever
 * touches a `dist` or resolves an `exports` map.
 *
 * This file is the second instrument. It lives here rather than in core for the
 * reason `packages/harness` exists at all: measuring `@blobatar/react` means
 * depending on `@blobatar/react`, and core cannot — the adapter peer-depends on
 * core, so a devDependency the other way makes turbo's `^build` graph cyclic.
 * Harness already declares every adapter and is never published.
 *
 * ## Why the consumer tree is built by hand
 *
 * A fixture written inside the workspace and importing `@blobatar/react` does
 * not measure `dist`. It measures core's *source*, silently:
 * `packages/react/tsconfig.json` aliases `blobatar/*` back to `../blobatar/src`
 * so a curve edit shows up without a build, and Bun applies the tsconfig
 * nearest the *importing* file — which, for `packages/react/dist/index.js`, is
 * that one. The alias is correct and must stay; it just cannot be in scope
 * here. Bun.build's `tsconfig` option does not override it (tried — the
 * per-file lookup wins), so the fixture is built in a tree that contains no
 * tsconfig at all: each package's `package.json` and `dist` copied under a
 * scratch `node_modules`, resolved by name through the real `exports` maps.
 *
 * Measured through the alias, `@blobatar/react` reported 5342 B rather than
 * 5228 — a number 114 B off, for core's source, from a fixture that looked
 * exactly like it was measuring the published package.
 *
 * Copied rather than `npm pack`ed, and that is a trade with a known edge.
 * A tarball would also prove the `files` field, but `npm pack` runs `prepack`,
 * which for core is `bun run build`, which starts by deleting `dist` — the
 * exact race `turbo.json` explains under `check`. A gate may not be the thing
 * that wipes a `dist` another task is reading. CI's `Pack` step covers `files`
 * on its own, after everything else has finished.
