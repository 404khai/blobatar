/**
 * The option matrix every adapter is compared over.
 *
 * Extracted from `adapters.test.ts` when the React Native adapter arrived,
 * because that one cannot join the roster in that file. It renders no `<img>`,
 * so the static assertion there does not hold for it, and it has no `animate`
 * at all, so half the table's cases do not exist on its platform. It gets its
 * own file and a different instrument, the way `@blobatar/svelte` needed the
 * ship gate to grow a second way of measuring (ADR-0010).
 *
 * What it must not get is a different *matrix*. Two adapters compared over two
 * lists agree about whatever they happen to share, and the case nobody checks
 * is the one that breaks, so the list lives here and both files read it, for
 * the same reason `test/golden/corpus.ts` is shared by the fixture's writer and
 * its checker.
