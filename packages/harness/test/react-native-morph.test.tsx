/**
 * `MorphingBlobatar` settles onto the blobatar `Blobatar` draws.
 *
 * The oracle, stated once: **at a frozen pose, an animated blobatar's rendered
 * geometry must equal the static one's.** Core asserts that as arithmetic in
 * `test/morph.test.ts`, over every pose and four hundred seeds, which is the
 * wide and cheap half. This is the narrow and real half: it asserts the
 * *adapter* wired the arithmetic up: that the right transform reached the right
 * group, that the eye groups nest inside the body wrap rather than beside it,
 * that the fills landed on the elements rather than on the wrapper, and that
 * nothing is drawn twice or not at all.
 *
 * That is a different failure class from core's, and one core cannot see. A
 * transposed pair of eye transforms passes every assertion in core and puts
 * `wink` on the wrong side of the face here.
 *
 * The comparison is a settled morph, because a settled morph is the only frame
 * with a static counterpart to compare against. `renderToStaticMarkup` gives
 * exactly that: no `requestAnimationFrame` runs during a server render, so what
 * comes out is the component's mount state, which is the target pose with no
 * transition, which is also what a real device draws on first paint, and the
 * reason the morph deliberately does not run on mount.
 *
 * Geometry is compared to a hundredth of a unit rather than exactly, and that
 * is the honest tolerance rather than a loosened one: the static path bakes the
 * pose into coordinates and rounds after, this one rounds the drawn coordinates
 * and carries them through a matrix, so the two differ by less than the
 * rounding step the renderer already introduces. Core's test says the same
 * thing at the same precision, with the derivation.
 *
 * `react-native-svg` is stubbed. See `react-native-stub.ts` for what that does
 * and does not prove.
